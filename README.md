 Machine translation is the translation of a text from one natural language into another natural language without human intervention and is completely automatic by computer.
The history of machine translation goes back many years and researchers have always tried to be able to translate the living languages ​​of the world and understand the meaning of each text, because in recent years with the advancement of technology and science, articles or books published in the world They are not our mother language and translation of these texts requires technical knowledge of that language.
